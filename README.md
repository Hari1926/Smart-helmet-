 # Smart-helmet-
 The smart helmet project is my own project. This project is the bike does not start without wearing the helmet, here the helmet act as a key. It became every one to wear the helmet and prevent from heavy injuries during accident. Here I will use transmitterand receiver for the signal transmission. The transmitter is insert in the helmet, the key ignition is set at belt of the helmet. And the receiver is insert in the bike to receive the signal from the helmet and Start the vehicle. The helmet is paired with every vehicle by using blutooth connection. The both helmet and bike contains blutooth module to pair with them. The additional features also inserted in helmet for the better performance. The alcoholic sensor MQ3 is inserted in the mouth portion of the helmet. If the person is involved in drink and drive the vehicle will not start by detecting using MQ3 sensor. And display the information as you are drunked and bike will not start and the information is send to the our personal mobile by using GSM. The GSM is used to send to notification and sms to the mobile about the incidents of the helmet data. Then the helmet contains temperature sensor MAX30205MTA to verify whether the person wear a helmet in head or not. And it also avoid person not to drive vehicle who  suffered from fever. The helmet contains battery and solar to charge the battery in helmet portion.
